                <p>The manuscript 1847 census, containing forty-three elements of information
                    for each of more than five thousand households in Philadelphia,
                    was used to prepare <i>A Statistical Inquiry into the Condition
                        of the People of Colour of the City and Districts of Philadelphia
                    </i>(1849), a report of forty-four pages. This is aggregated data-&#151;the
                    raw data of the census manipulated in particular ways for a particular
                    purpose. The existence of the raw data allows modern researchers
                    to reaggregate the data&#151;to ask new questions and not be bound
                    by the conceptions of social scientists of 160 years past. </p>
                <p>The data also tells stories. The compilers were interested in the broad
                    picture of the condition of the African-American population. But
                    each individual household record tells a story&#151;how one particular
                    family faired in 1847: what occupation, what property, what education,
                    what pay. The information puts faces, or at least individual stories,
                    to what is otherwise aggregate data. We have information on families
                    nearly destitute, living in conditions of poverty; we have families
                    apparently prospering. We can move from the micro to the macro view
                    of the African American experience. </p>
                <p>Why was the census undertaken? The census was undertaken by a committee
                    appointed by the Meeting for Sufferings of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting
                    (Orthodox). The purpose of the committee initially was to prepare
                    a report on the slave trade, but after further consideration, the
                    committee determined that it was also important to examine the condition
                    of the African-American population of Philadelphia both to document
                    the existence of an &quot;industrious and thriving&quot; portion
                    of that population and to discover what portion of the community
                    may have been in need of attention and assistance. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The census data can be translated into human stories. Individual
                    families have names and histories:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>&#151;Amy Wood, widow, born a slave and manumitted by Lucy Wood,
                        sister to Patrick Henry; heading a family of five, three under
                        fifteen, none born in Pennsylvania; two attending school, one
                        &quot;at service.&quot; Amy Wood is looking for work. The Wood
                        family shared a room with Adeline Kelley, born a slave, and manumitted
                        by Ann Thomas Bedford, of Richmond, Virginia; her husband remains
                        a slave, probably in Virginia. She supports her family by washing,
                        for which she receives $1.50 per week; none of her three children
                        are in school, and two are working at the tobacco mill. </p>
                    <p>&#151;Robert F. Jones and wife, born free and in Pennsylvania.
                        Robert teaches school for $200 a year, and receives another $150
                        teaching vocal music. The wife &quot;keeps house.&quot; Both are
                        literate and attend church.</p>

                    The current project is intended to present the documentary resources
                    of the 1847 to the widest possible audience through the web. We
                    anticipate that some users will be researchers, interested in social
                    science approaches to reconstructing the economic and social conditions
                    of Philadelphia or a representative African-American community in
                    the North prior to the Civil War. Other researchers may be interested
                    in family genealogy, or trades and occupations.</p>
